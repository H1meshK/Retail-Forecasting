# Retail Analytics & Pricing Simulator – Power BI
An end-to-end **Retail Demand Forecasting & Pricing Strategy Simulator** built in **Power BI**, leveraging historical sales data, forecast models, and price elasticity to enable **data-driven decision-making** for SKU-level pricing and inventory optimization.

## Overview
This project simulates a **real-world retail analytics dashboard** that allows stakeholders to:
- Monitor **historical & forecasted demand** across SKUs, departments, and stores.
- Identify **seasonal sales patterns** and SKU-specific trends.
- Test **price change scenarios** interactively and evaluate their **impact on revenue**.
- Optimize pricing using **elasticity-driven insights**.
The dashboard is fully interactive with slicers, drilldowns, and KPI visuals.

## 1. Data Sources
### Primary
- **Walmart Store Sales Forecasting** (Kaggle)  
  - 45+ stores, multiple SKUs, holidays, markdowns.  
- **Retail Price Optimization Dataset** (Kaggle / Google Dataset Search)  
  - Pricing sensitivity and discount patterns.

### Supplementary
- **Weather Data** – Seasonal demand drivers via OpenWeather API (free tier).  
- **Calendar Data** – Public holidays and festivals for promotional spikes.

**Data Integration:**  
Merged using **Power Query** in Excel → realistic, multi-factor demand drivers for robust forecasting.


## 2. Forecasting Methodology
### Models Used
- **Statistical Models:** SARIMA & Prophet – for seasonality and trends.
- **Machine Learning Models:** XGBoost / LightGBM – for promo-heavy SKUs (captures non-linear effects).
- **Ensemble Approach:** Weighted combination of statistical & ML models.

**Accuracy Gains:**  
Ensemble improved forecast accuracy by **14% MAPE reduction** vs ARIMA for promotions-heavy SKUs.

## 3. Competitive Features
- **Dynamic Pricing Engine:** Calculates price elasticity for each SKU and recommends optimal prices to maximize revenue/margin.
- **Promotion Impact Simulator:** Interactive slider in Power BI to simulate discounts and view demand changes instantly.
- **Stockout Risk Alerts:** Highlights SKUs projected to run out before next replenishment.

## 4. Power BI Dashboard Flow
1. **Executive Overview**  
   - Total forecast revenue vs. last year  
   - Forecast accuracy (MAPE)  
   - Price change recommendations summary

2. **SKU Demand Forecast**  
   - Line charts by SKU  
   - Seasonality decomposition

3. **Dynamic Pricing Simulator**  
   - Price elasticity scatter plot  
   - What-if slider for % price change

4. **Stockout Risk Heatmap**  
   - Store × SKU risk matrix with conditional flags
